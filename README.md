The First Website Ever Created is Still Online:
The very first website, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, is still online! It's a simple,
 text-based page that provides information about the World Wide Web project.
 The website was hosted on CERN's server and marked the beginning of the internet as we know it today.
You can still visit it at its original URL: http://info.cern.ch.
